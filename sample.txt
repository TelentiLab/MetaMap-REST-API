Human CCR5Delta32 (rs333) polymorphism has no influence on severity and mortality of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection in Brazilian patients from the post pandemic period.

BACKGROUND:
Influenza is an acute and highly contagious viral respiratory infection that causes significant morbidity and mortality. The identification of host genetic factors associated with susceptibility and severity of influenza virus infection is of paramount importance. Previous studies evaluating the potential involvement of the CCR5Delta32 polymorphism (rs333), a 32 base pair deletion in CC motif chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) gene, in severity and mortality of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infected individuals have been reported, but their results are quite conflicting.

OBJECTIVES:
The aim of this study was the evaluation of the CCR5Delta32 frequency in individuals with mild, severe and fatal influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection and its putative association with clinical and epidemiologic data.

PATIENTS/METHODS:
A total of 432 individuals were included in this study and classified according to their clinical status, into the following groups: influenza like illness (ILI) (n = 153); severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) (n = 173) and fatal (n = 106) cases. The samples were collected in the post pandemic period, from 2012 to 2018. Individuals were further stratified according to their clinical and epidemiological data. The CCR5Delta32 variant was genotyped by PCR amplification and a subset of samples was further submitted to Sanger sequencing.

RESULTS:
The different clinical groups (ILI, SARI and fatal) presented similar distribution of wt/wt and wt/Delta32 genotypes and CCR5Delta32 allele frequencies. Genotype Delta32/Delta32 was not detected in our study. Additionally, no association between wt/wt and wt/Delta32 genotypes and dyspnea, a clinical factor for influenza complications was found. Similarly, no significant differences in the distribution of wt/wt and wt/Delta32 genotypes and CCR5Delta32 variant allele frequencies were observed in samples from the different Brazilian geographical regions.

CONCLUSIONS:
The CCR5Delta32 variant does not influence the susceptibility to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 severe disease or mortality in individuals from Brazil.

CCR5Delta32 - A piece of protection in the inflammatory puzzle of multiple sclerosis susceptibility.

BACKGROUND:
Leucocyte infiltration and activation in the central nervous system (CNS) is an important step in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS). The Chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) is implicated in immune cell migration and cytokine release in the CNS, and it was demonstrated to strongly contribute to CNS inflammation and damage in several models of sterile and pathogen-mediated CNS diseases. Although the inhibition of CCR5 results in a beneficial effect in experimental models of MS, conflicting results have been found about the loss-of-function variant CCR5Delta32 (rs333) in MS patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of CCR5Delta32 and MS in a Brazilian case/control cohort.

PATIENTS AND METHODS:
261 MS patients and 435 healthy controls were genotyped for CCR5Delta32. Allelic and genotypic frequencies were compared between patients and controls (case/control analysis), and among patients classified according to the MS clinical form (relapsing remitting versus progressive) and severity (EDSS, MSSS and progression index).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION:
The CCR5Delta32 variant frequency was statistically higher in controls as compared to patients presenting European-derived ethnic background. The variant was more frequent in progressive MS as compared to RR-MS patients, and, although not statistically significant, a higher frequency of the truncated allele was observed among patients with less severe forms of MS. These findings emphasize the potential involvement of CCR5 signaling in CNS inflammation and damage in MS.

CONCLUSION:
The CCR5Delta32 deletion is a protective factor against the development and progression of MS in European-derived Brazilian patients.


Correlations between polymorphisms in the uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase 1A and C-C motif chemokine receptor 5 genes and infection with the hepatitis B virus in three ethnic groups in China.

Objective To determine whether genetic polymorphisms in the uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase 1A ( UGT1A) and the C-C motif chemokine receptor 5 ( CCR5) genes are associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in Yi, Yao and Han ethnic groups in the Guizhou Province of China. Methods The study enrolled subjects with and without HBV infection. Whole blood was used for DNA genotyping using standard techniques. The study determined the frequencies of several polymorphic alleles ( UGT1A6 [rs2070959], UGT1A1 [rs8175347], CCR5-59029 [rs1799987] and CCR5Delta32 [rs333]) and then characterized their relationship with HBV infection. Results A total of 404 subjects were enrolled in the study: 138 from the Yao group, 101 from the Yi group and 165 from the Han group. There was a significant difference in the frequency of UGT1A1 rs8175347 polymorphisms among the three groups. The rates of 7TA carriers of UGT1A1 rs8175347 in all three groups were significantly higher than the other genotypes. Individuals with genotype AA of UGT1A6 rs2070959 in the Yi group had a higher risk for HBV infection than in the Yao and Han groups. The frequency of genotype GG in CCR5-59029 in the Yao group was significantly higher than in the Yi group. The genotypes of CCR5Delta32 were not associated with HBV infection. Conclusion These findings provide genetic and epidemiological evidence for an association of UGT1A and CCR5-59029 polymorphisms with HBV infection in Chinese Yi and Yao populations.

CCR5Delta32 (rs333) polymorphism is associated with decreased risk of chronic and aggressive periodontitis: A case-control analysis based in disease resistance and susceptibility phenotypes.
Chronic and aggressive periodontitis are infectious diseases characterized by the irreversible destruction of periodontal tissues, which is mediated by the host inflammatory immune response triggered by periodontal infection. The chemokine receptor CCR5 play an important role in disease pathogenesis, contributing to pro-inflammatory response and osteoclastogenesis. CCR5Delta32 (rs333) is a loss-of-function mutation in the CCR5 gene, which can potentially modulate the host response and, consequently periodontitis outcome. Thus, we investigated the effect of the CCR5Delta32 mutation over the risk to suffer periodontitis in a cohort of Brazilian patients (total N=699), representative of disease susceptibility (chronic periodontitis, N=197; and aggressive periodontitis, N=91) or resistance (chronic gingivitis, N=193) phenotypes, and healthy subjects (N=218). Additionally, we assayed the influence of CCR5Delta32 in the expression of the biomarkers TNFalpha, IL-1beta, IL-10, IL-6, IFN-gamma and T-bet, and key periodontal pathogens P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, and T. denticola. In the association analysis of resistant versus susceptible subjects, CCR5Delta32 mutant allele-carriers proved significantly protected against chronic (OR 0.49; 95% CI 0.29-0.83; p-value 0.01) and aggressive (OR 0.46; 95% CI 0.22-0.94; p-value 0.03) periodontitis. Further, heterozygous subjects exhibited significantly decreased expression of TNFalpha in periodontal tissues, pointing to a functional effect of the mutation in periodontal tissues during the progression of the disease. Conversely, no significant changes were observed in the presence or quantity of the periodontal pathogens P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, and T. denticola in the subgingival biofilm that could be attributable to the mutant genotype.


Cytokine gene polymorphism associations with congenital cytomegalovirus infection and sensorineural hearing loss.Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common viral agent of congenital infections and a leading nongenetic cause of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). The host immunologic factors that render a developing foetus prone to intrauterine CMV infection and development of hearing loss are unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the potential associations between the polymorphisms within cytokine and cytokine receptors genes, and the risk of congenital CMV infection, and the hearing outcome. A panel of 11 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): TNF rs1799964, TNF rs1800629, TNFRSF1A rs4149570, IL1B rs16944, IL1B rs1143634, IL10 rs1800896, IL10RA rs4252279, IL12B rs3212227, CCL2 rs1024611, CCL2 rs13900, CCR5 rs333 was genotyped in 470 infants (72 with confirmed intrauterine CMV infection and 398 uninfected controls), and related to congenital CMV infection, and the outcome. In multivariate analysis, the IL1B rs16944 TT and TNF rs1799964 TC genotypes were significantly associated with intrauterine CMV infection (aOR = 2.32; 95% CI, 1.11-4.89; p = 0.032, and aOR = 2.17, 95% CI, 1.25-3.77; p = 0.007, respectively). Twenty-two out of 72 congenitally infected newborns had confirmed SNHL. Carriers of CT or TT genotype of CCL2 rs13900 had increased risk of hearing loss at birth and at 6 months of age (aOR = 3.59; p = 0.028 and aOR = 4.10; p = 0.039, respectively). This is the first study to report an association between SNPs in IL1B, TNF, and CCL2, and susceptibility to congenital CMV infection (IL1B and TNF) and SNHL (CCL2).

Analysis of CCR5 gene polymorphisms in 321 healthy Saudis using Next Generation Sequencing.

AIMS:
To investigate the extent of CCR5 polymorphism in the healthy Saudi population.

METHOD:
A total of 321 healthy Saudi individuals were sequenced using the ion AmpliseqTM Exome kit (Life Technologies, USA) on genomic DNA following manufacturer's protocol. Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) reads were aligned to the human reference genome (hg19 build) with Torrent Suite Software (v5.0.2) and the variants were called using the Torrent Variant Caller plugin (v5.0) and imported into Ion Reporter Server (v5.0) for the annotation. CCR5 coding exons variants were filtered and checked against the NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project (NHLBI), NCBI Reference dbSNPs database, 1000 genomes and Exome Aggregation Consortium datasets (ExAC).

RESULTS:
A total of 475 variants were identified. Table 1 shows polymorphisms/mutations detected within exons that introduced an amino acid change, deletion or copy number variants (CNV). Three mutations are predicted to influence CCR5 function, including the 32bp deletion (Rs333). Four polymorphisms were detected, plus two CNV.

CONCLUSIONS:
This is the first report on sequencing the full CCR5 gene using NGS in the Saudi population. Here we demonstrate seven polymorphisms/mutations that were reported before. All were detected within very low frequency including the delta 32 mutation. However, we report for the first time copy number variants at two CCR5 gene locations; 45072265 and 38591712.

CCR5-Delta32 gene polymorphism is related to celiac disease and autoimmune thyroiditis coincidence in patients with type 1 diabetes.

AIM:
The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between CCR5-Delta32 polymorphism and the coincidence of celiac and autoimmune thyroid diseases with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) in children.

METHODS:
420 children with T1D aged 15.5+/-3.0years and 350 healthy controls were studied. Characterization of CCR5-Delta32 genotypes (rs333) was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

RESULTS:
The allele frequency was significantly different in diabetic children as compared to the healthy controls (p<0.0001). We found negative association between T1D and Delta32 allele (OR=0.383; 95% CI=0.268-0.549). Besides, we observed alterations in the frequencies of CCR5-Delta32 genotypes due to celiac and autoimmune thyroid diseases. The risk of celiac disease for patient carriers of the 32-bp deletion was more than threefold higher than for noncarriers (OR=3.490; 95% CI=1.357-8.859; p=0.009). Similar results were obtained in the case of autoimmune thyroiditis. The risk of autoimmune thyroiditis for patient carriers of the 32-bp deletion was also more than threefold higher than for noncarriers (OR=3.466; 95% CI=1.754-6.849; p=0.0004).

CONCLUSIONS:
The findings of our studies suggest that the CCR5-Delta32 polymorphism is associated with type 1 diabetes mellitus and the Delta32 allele increases the risk of celiac disease and autoimmune thyroid disorders in patients with T1D.

[Association of polymorphic markers of chemokine genes, their receptors, and CD14 gene with coronary atherosclerosis].

Atherosclerosis represents an inflammatory response to the disturbance of the endothelial layer in the arterial bloodstream. In the present study, an analysis of associations of polymorphic markers for the genes controlling synthesis of proteins involved in atherosclerosis pathogenesis in coronary atherosclerosis (CA) patients (217 subjects) and in a control group (250 subjects) was conducted. The following genes were examined: rs991804 (CCL2 gene), rs1126579 (CXCR2 gene), rs4074 (CXCL1 gene), rs4073 (CXCL8 gene), rs333 (CCR5 gene), rs2471859 (CXCR4 gene), rs1801157 (CXCL12 gene), and rs2569190 (CD14 gene). Using the Monte Carlo and Markov chain (APSampler) method, allele/genotype combinations associated with both low and high CA risk were revealed. The most important findings included the following: CXCR4*T/T + CCL2*C + CCR5*I/I (P perm = 1 * 10-6, OR = 0.44, 95% CI 0.3-0.63), CXCR2*C + CD14*C + CXCL12*G + CCL2*C + CCR5*D (P perm = 4 * 10-6, OR = 5.78, 95% CI 2.34-14.28), CD14*C + CCL2*C/C + CCR5*D (P perm = 6.3 * 10-6, OR = 5.81, 95% CI 2.17-15.56), CXCL8*A + CXCR2*C + CD14*T + CXCR4*C (P perm = 0.01, OR = 3.21, 95% CI 1.63-6.31).


Genomic ancestry evaluated by ancestry-informative markers in patients with sickle cell disease.

The beta(s) mutation is responsible for the most aggressive form of sickle cell disease, has a predominantly African origin, and arrived in Brazil through the slave trade. However, the Brazilian population is highly miscegenated, underscoring the importance of ancestry-informative markers (AIMs) for the identification of the genetic structure of a population. In this study, we have estimated the genetic contributions of various ethnicities in individuals with sickle cell disease in the microregion of Jequie, Bahia, in Brazil, by using AIMs, and compared the findings to those from a phenotypic characterization. Eight AIMs were analyzed: AT3 (rs3138521), DRD2 (rs1079598), APO (rs3138522), PV92, Sb19.3 (rs3138524), CKM (rs4884), LPL (rs285), and CCR5Delta32 (rs333). Samples were subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The amplified products were electrophoresed on agarose gels, and the data were statistically analyzed using Genepop, FSTAT 2.9, and Admix3. Phenotypic classification showed a high frequency of mulattos  (85%) in the Brazilian population; however, ancestry-informative markers indicated that 44, 42, and 11% of the population had European, African, and native American ancestries, respectively. The phenotypic classification is justified as a complementary method for the characterization of the genetic ancestry in patients with sickle cell disease, as it confirms the molecular findings regarding ancestry.

CCR2 and CCR5 genes polymorphisms in women with cervical lesions from Pernambuco, Northeast Region of Brazil: a case-control study.

Polymorphisms in chemokine receptors play an important role in the progression of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) to cervical cancer (CC). Our study examined the association of CCR2-64I (rs1799864) andCCR5-Delta32 (rs333) polymorphisms with susceptibility to develop cervical lesion (CIN and CC) in a Brazilian population. The genotyping of 139 women with cervical lesions and 151 women without cervical lesions for the CCR2-64I and CCR5-Delta32 polymorphisms were performed using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The individuals carrying heterozygous or homozygous genotypes (GA+AA) for CCR2-64I polymorphisms seem to be at lower risk for cervical lesion [odds ratio (OR) = 0.37, p = 0.0008)]. The same was observed for the A allele (OR = 0.39, p = 0.0002), while no association was detected (p > 0.05) with CCR5-Delta32 polymorphism. Regarding the human papillomavirus (HPV) type, patients carrying the CCR2-64Ipolymorphism were protected against infection by HPV type 16 (OR = 0.35, p = 0.0184). In summary, our study showed a protective effect ofCCR2-64I rs1799864 polymorphism against the development of cervical lesions (CIN and CC) and in the susceptibility of HPV 16 infection.

Genetic Susceptibility to Cardiac and Digestive Clinical Forms of Chronic Chagas Disease: Involvement of the CCR5 59029 A/G Polymorphism.

The clinical manifestations of chronic Chagas disease include the cardiac form of the disease and the digestive form. Not all the factors that act in the variable clinical course of this disease are known. This study investigated whether the CCR5Delta32 (rs333) and CCR5 59029 A/G (promoter region--rs1799987) polymorphisms of the CCR5 gene are associated with different clinical forms of chronic Chagas disease and with the severity of left ventricular systolic dysfunction in patients with chronic Chagas heart disease (CCHD). The antibodies anti-T. cruzi were identified by ELISA. PCR and PCR-RFLP were used to identify the CCR5Delta32 and CCR5 59029 A/G polymorphisms. The chi-square test was used to compare variables between groups. There was a higher frequency of the AA genotype in patients with CCHD compared with patients with the digestive form of the disease and the control group. The results also showed a high frequency of the AG genotype in patients with the digestive form of the disease compared to the other groups. The results of this study show that the CCR5Delta32 polymorphism does not seem to influence the different clinical manifestations of Chagas disease but there is involvement of the CCR5 59029 A/G polymorphism in susceptibility to the different forms of chronic Chagas disease. Besides, these polymorphisms do not influence left ventricular systolic dysfunction in patients with CCHD.

The CCR5Delta32 (rs333) polymorphism is not a predisposing factor for severe pandemic influenza in the Brazilian admixed population.

BACKGROUND:
Recent studies have tried to identify host genetic variants that could explain severe cases and deaths in infection with Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, especially among children and young adults. CCR5 is a chemokine receptor expressed on T cells, macrophages and dendritic cells, which is an important mediator of leukocyte chemotaxis during the immune response. A deletion mutation (Delta32) in this gene interferes with the response of immune cells, impairing viral clearance. We evaluated the CCR5Delta32 polymorphism (rs333) in individuals of the Brazilian admixed population with a diagnosis of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection.

METHODS:
A total of 330 subjects with a diagnosis of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, evaluated at health services in the northern and northeastern regions of Brazil between June 2009 and August 2010, were genotyped for the Delta32 deletion (rs333). The cases were classified according to the progression of infection into a group of hospitalized patients (n = 156) and a group of non-hospitalized patients (n = 174).

RESULTS:
No significant differences in the allele or genotype frequencies of the CCR5Delta32 polymorphism were observed between non-hospitalized and hospitalized patients (p = 0.289 and p = 0.431, respectively).

CONCLUSION:
The Delta32 deletion in the CCR5 gene is not associated with an unfavorable outcome in patients infected with Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in the Brazilian admixed population.

CCR5Delta32 (rs333) polymorphism is associated with the susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus in female Brazilian patients.

The role of CCR5Delta32 (rs333) polymorphism in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has been evaluated worldwide. The aim of this study was to determine the association between CCR5Delta32 polymorphism with the susceptibility to SLE and the activity of disease in female Southern Brazilian patients. The study enrolled 169 female SLE patients and 132 unrelated female healthy individuals. Baseline clinical, laboratorial characteristics, and the SLE activity (determined using the SLEDAI) were evaluated according to the CCR5Delta32 genotypes. The CCR5Delta32 polymorphism was determined from genomic DNA using a polymerase chain reaction. The frequencies of the genotypes CCR5/CCR5, CCR5/CCR5Delta32, and CCR5Delta32/CCR5Delta32 were 87.6, 11.8, and 0.6 %, respectively, among the patients and 96.2, 3.8, and 0.0 %, respectively, among the controls [CCR5/CCR5 vs. CCR5/CCR5Delta32 + CCR5Delta32/CCR5Delta32: p = 0.0081, odds ratio 3.604 (95 % confidence interval 1.321-9.4836)]. The frequencies of the CCR5 and the CCR5Delta32 alleles were 93.2 and 6.8 % among the patients, and 98.1 and 1.9 % among the controls, respectively (p = 0.0047, OR 3.758, 95 % CI 1.409-10.80). Patients carrying the genotypes with the CCR5Delta32 allele presented earlier age of onset of disease (p = 0.0293) and higher levels of anti-dsDNA (p = 0.0255) than those carrying the wild-type genotype. When the analysis was adjusted for ethnicity, only the age at onset of disease remained significant (p > 0.05). The results suggest that the CCR5Delta32 polymorphism might be associated with SLE genetic predisposition among female Brazilian patients and the age at onset of the disease; however, this genetic variant was not associated with the activity of SLE in this population.

Chemokine receptor V Delta32 deletion in multiple sclerosis patients in Csongrad County in Hungary and the North-Bacska region in Serbia.

The roles of chemokine receptor V (CCR5) and its polymorphism, rs333 in multiple sclerosis (MS) are controversial. We investigated the receptor and its deletion in a large MS (428) and a numerous control (831) population in Csongrad County (Hungary) and North-Bacska (Serbia). Taqman probes firstly were used for the allele discrimination. There was no significant difference in genotype (OR=1.092, 95% CI=0.807-1.478, p=0.568 for wt/wt (wt=wild type allele) vs wt/Delta32, Delta32/Delta32 (Delta32=Delta32 base pair deletion allele)) or allele frequency (OR=0.914, 95% CI=0.692-1.207, p=0.525). Neither the deletion nor the wt allele affected the Expanded Disability Status Scale score or the age at onset. Our results indicate no association between the CCR5 Delta32 allele and MS.

Absence of Association between CCR5 rs333 Polymorphism and Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a malignant disorder that originates from one single hematopoietic precursor committed to B- or T-cell lineage. Ordinarily, these cells express CCR5 chemokine receptor, which directs the immune response to a cellular pattern and is involved in cancer pathobiology. The genetic rs333 polymorphism of CCR5 (Delta32), results in a diminished receptor expression, thus leading to impaired cell trafficking. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of CCR5 chemokine receptor rs333 polymorphism in the pathogenesis of ALL. The genotype distribution was studied in 79 patients and compared with 80 control subjects, in a childhood population of Southern Brazil. Genotyping was performed using DNA samples amplified by polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers (PCR-SSP). The homozygous (Delta32/Delta32) deletion was not observed in any subject involved in the study. Heterozygous genotype was not associated with ALL risk (OR 0.7%; 95% CI 0.21-2.32; P > 0.05), nor recurrence status of ALL (OR 0.86; 95% CI 0.13-5.48; P > 0.05). This work demonstrated, for the first time, no significant differences in the frequency of the CCR5/Delta32 genotype between ALL and control groups, indicating no effect of this genetic variant on the ALL susceptibility and recurrence risk.

Association of chemokine receptor gene variants with HIV-1 genotype predicted tropism.

Abstract
OBJECTIVES:
As a switch from chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5 [CCR5 (R5)] to chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 [CXCR4 (X4)] HIV-1 tropism is associated with symptomatic and AIDS stages of infection, while chemokine receptor gene variants modify the tempo of HIV disease progression, we aimed to analyse the association between pretreatment HIV-1 tropism and chemokine polymorphisms known to restrict disease progression.

METHODS:
V3 genotype tropism prediction was performed in a group of 221 treatment-naive patients, with subsequent CCR5 Delta32 (rs333), CCR2 V64I (rs1799864), CCR5 promoter (-627 C/T; rs1799988) and CX3CR1 V249I (rs3732378) genotyping performed in 206 patients. Alleles with a protective effect were assigned positive values while risk alleles were assigned negative values to calculate genetic scores. chi(2) tests, Mann-Whitney U-tests and logistic and linear regression models were used for statistical analyses.

RESULTS:
R5 tropism was found in 85.5% of patients (n = 189) using a false positive rate (FPR) of 5.75% and in 72.8% of patients (n = 161) using an FPR of 10%. A higher frequency of the 5.75% FPR predicted R5 tropism was associated with the CX3CR1 A allele (P = 0.027). Lower additive genetic scores were associated with an increased frequency of 5.75% FPR predicted R5 tropism (P = 0.0059), with the trend confirmed by logistic regression [odds ratio (OR) 0.5819; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.3457-0.9795; P = 0.0416]. Viral load tended to increase with decreasing genetic score in the logistic regression analysis (slope = -0.127 +/- 0.076; P = 0.095; r(2)  = 0.161).

CONCLUSIONS:
The CX3CR1 A allele and lower genetic scores may restrict the switch of HIV-1 tropism from R5 to X4. This effect may be associated with the amount of co-receptor on the cell surface. Chemokine receptor gene polymorphisms influence both disease progression and tropism variability.

[Association of chemokines and their receptors genes polymorphisms with risk of myocardial infarction].OBJECTIVE:
To assess the association of variations in chemokines (CCL5, CCL2), chemokine receptor (CCR5 and CCR2) genes with susceptibility to myocardial infarction (MI) through a case-control study.

METHODS:
Genotypes of patients with MI (n = 634) were compared with those of controls (n = 601). Genetic polymorphisms of CCL5 rs2107538 (-403G > A), CCL2 rs1024611 (-2518A > G), CCR5 rs333 ( delta 32 ins or del) and CCR2 rs1799864 (190G > A) of 1235 individuals were determined with polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Particular genotypes were confirmed with DNA sequencing.

RESULTS:
No subject was found to carry the CCR5 - delta 32 allele. No association was found between CCL2 rs1024611 and CCR2 rs1799864 polymorphisms and MI. For CCL5 rs2107538 polymorphism, the A allele has occurred at a higher frequency in MI patients than controls, and its AA genotype has been associated with a significantly increased risk of MI independent of conventional risk factors (OR = 3.346, 95%CI = 1.938-5.775, P < 0.01, AA vs. GG). Further analysis indicated that MI patients had significantly more A-403 - A-2518 haplotype (CCL5 -403G > A and CCL2 -2518A > G, 21.8% vs. 26.6%, OR = 1.229, 95%CI = 1.012-1.493, P = 0.038) and AA or AA genotype (CCL5 -403G > A - CCL2 -2518A > G, 5.0% vs. 12.1%, OR = 3.245, 95%CI = 1.780-5.914, P < 0.01).

CONCLUSION:
Although our data dose not support an association between CCL2 rs1024611, CCR2 rs1799864 and CCR5 rs333 polymorphisms and MI, genetic variation in CCL5 gene may still be a useful marker for assessing susceptibility to MI in ethnic Han Chinese population.

CCR2 and CCR5 genes polymorphisms in benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer.
Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer (PCa) are two chronic conditions, very common in aged men, that have been associated to inflammatory process. Chemokines and their receptors are recognized as critical mediators of inflammatory responses, they regulate immune cell migration and are implicated in tumor pathogenesis. The impact of two chemokine receptor gene polymorphisms, CCR2-64I (rs1799864) and CCR5-Delta32 (rs333), was evaluated in BPH and PCa. 385 DNA samples (130 BPH, 136 PCa, 119 healthy control) were genotyped. The allele frequencies were similar among control, BPH and PCa groups. Median of serum PSA levels was different between groups: 0.79, 1.45 and 6.91 ng/mL in control, BPH and PCa groups, respectively (all p<0.001). The prostate volume median was 20.00 cm(3) in the control group, thus, lower than BPH (35.35 cm(3)) and PCa (35.80 cm(3)) (both p<0.001), nevertheless no statistical significant difference was observed between BPH and PCa patients (p=0.172). Remarkably, CCR2-64I was a protective factor to PCa when compared with BPH (OR=0.550; 95%CI=0.311-0.975), although the statistically significant difference was lost after correction for multiple comparisons. No significant associations of CCR5-Delta32 variant were observed with BPH, PCa or PCa clinicopathologic status. Our data suggest the influence of CCR2-64I variant in the development of prostate cancer.

Host genetic risk factors for community-acquired pneumonia.
This study was conducted to establish the contribution of genetic host factors in the susceptibility to community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in the Russian population. Patients with CAP (n=334), volunteers without a previous history of CAP, constantly exposed to infectious agents, control A group (n=141) and a second control group B consisted of healthy persons (n=314) were included in the study. All subjects were genotyped for 13 polymorphic variants in the genes of xenobiotics detoxification CYP1A1 (rs2606345, rs4646903, and rs1048943), GSTM1 (Ins/del), GSTT1 (Ins/del), ABCB1 rs1045642); immune and inflammation response IL-6 (rs1800795), TNF-a (rs1800629), MBL2 (rs7096206), CCR5 (rs333), NOS3 (rs1799983), angiotensin-converting enzyme ACE (rs4340), and occlusive vascular disease/hyperhomocysteinemia MTHFR (rs1801133). Seven polymorphic variants in genes CYP1A1, GSTM1, ABCB1, NOS3, IL6, CCR5 and ACE were associated with CAP. For two genes CYP1A1 and GSTM1 associations remained significant after correction for multiple comparisons. Multiple analysis by the number of all risk genotypes showed a highly significant association with CAP (P=2.4*10(-7), OR=3.03, 95% CI 1.98-4.64) with the threshold for three risk genotypes. Using the ROC-analysis, the AUC value for multi-locus model was estimated as 68.38.


[Value of allele gene polymorphism of the inflammation system for prognosis of patients with myocardial infarction].
In recent years levels of a number of inflammatory markers namely C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) etc. are measured for the purpose of postinfarction risk evaluation. Dynamics of inflammatory markers concentrations can reflect processes occurring in atherosclerotic plaque and coronary arteries. Concentrations of inflammatory markers depend particularly on genetic factors affecting transcription levels of individual genes. This data suggest that genotypes which determine increased inflammatory markers levels in blood can increase risk of unfavorable events after myocardial infarction. STUDY PURPOSES: Analysis of influence of allelic polymorphisms C1444T of CRP gene (rs1130864), G(-174)A of IL6 gene (rs1800795), A(-308)G of TNF gene (rs1800629), G252A of LTA gene (rs909253), (-509) of TGFB1 gene (rsl800469) and delta32 (w/d) of CCR5 gene (rs333) on development of cardiac unfavorable events in Russian patients with MI during two years follow-up. 211 Russian patients were included (52.3+/-10.3 years), 160 men (50.1+/-10.6 years) and 51 women (55.2+/-10.1 years). After two years of follow-up patients were examined in hospital, or telephon call occurred for determination of patient's condition or end point assessment. The end points were cardiac death, recurrent MI, recurrent hospitalization with unstable angina or stroke, CABG or PTCA performing. The genotyping was performed by methods based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR): PCR-SSP and PCR-RFLP. Analysis revealed association of allele T (p=0.036, OR=1.6, 95%CI: 1.052.6) and of allele T carriage (genotypes CT+TT) (p=0.046, OR=1.9, 95%CI: 1.053.6) of polymorphism C1444T of CRP gene with unfavorable events development. Analysis of survival rate by Kaplan-Meier estimation showed that cumulative part of patients without unfavorable events was significantly lower among allele T carriers than among carriers of genotype C/C of polymorphism C1444T CRP. Allele A of polymorphism A252G of LTA gene was also associated with unfavorable events risk (p=0.034, OR=1.96, 95%CI: 1.073.06). There was no association of polymorphisms delta 32 (w/d) of CCR5 gene, A(-308)G of TNF gene, G(-174)C of IL-6 gene, C(-509)T of TGFB1 gene with unfavorable events development.


Validation of genetic variants associated with early acute rejection in kidney allograft transplantation.

Numerous reports have identified genetic variants associated with kidney transplant outcome, but only a few have been validated in subsequent studies. We analyzed the association of 21 previously reported genetic variants associated with acute rejection (AR), in an effort to validate these associations in our kidney transplant population. All recipients (n = 585) received Ab induction, rapid discontinuation of prednisone, and calcineurin inhibitors with either mycophenolate mofetil or sirolimus. Both univariate analysis and logistic regression were used for determining the association between the genotypes and AR. Univariate analysis detected one significant single-nucleotide polymorphism (p = 0.03), rs1801133, within the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene associated with AR. Logistic regression analysis identified two variants associated with AR, the 32-bp deletion within chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5 gene (rs333) and the p.222A/V variant (rs1801133) within the MTHFR gene. Although our analysis utilized a much larger cohort than used in previous reports, we were only able to detect an association with two of these variants. The lack of validation for the other 19 variants may be due to the small effect size, or that, they are not associated with AR. These results stress the need for larger cohorts for both future studies as well as for validation studies.


Distribution of polymorphisms in cytochrome P450 2B6, histocompatibility complex P5, chemokine coreceptor 5, and interleukin 28B genes in inhabitants from the central area of Argentina.
AIMS:
The selection of the most appropriate treatment for several diseases relies on a number of factors such as environment, age, gender, and nutrition. Additionally, the contribution of different genetic polymorphisms to treatment efficacy has been largely recognized. The lack of information on the pharmacogenetic profile of our population prompted us to analyze the frequency of polymorphisms known to be relevant to achieve treatment efficacy with different therapeutic agents in viral infectious diseases, such as Hepatitis C and AIDS.

RESULTS:
The allelic frequencies for the wild-type variant of the genes analyzed were cytochrome P450 2B6 (CYP2B6; rs3745274; 516G) 0.618 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.523, 0.711), chemokine coreceptor 5 (CCR5; rs333) 0.961 (95% CI: 0.942, 0.98), histocompatibility complex P5 (HCP5; rs2395029; 335T) 0.971 (95% CI: 0.937, 1), and interleukin 28B (IL28B; rs12979860; 12007005C) 0.656 (95% CI: 0.564, 0.747), respectively.

CONCLUSIONS:
Our data indicate that the genetic profile of the population studied is similar to that reported for other Caucasian populations, with only slight differences for CYP2B6. Noteworthy, the considerable number of patients carrying CYP2B6 (516T) and IL28B (12007005T) alleles underlies the importance of considering pharmacogenetic testing before starting drug therapy protocols to prevent toxicity and/or lack of effectiveness in AIDS or hepatitis C virus infections.


CCR5Delta32 variant and cardiovascular disease in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: a cohort study.

INTRODUCTION:
The aim of our study was to analyze the influence of the CCR5Delta32 polymorphism in the risk of cardiovascular (CV) events and subclinical atherosclerosis among patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

METHODS:
A total of 645 patients fulfilling the American Rheumatism Association 1987 revised classification criteria for RA were studied. Patients were genotyped for the CCR5 rs333 polymorphism using predesigned TaqMan assays. Also, HLA DRB1 genotyping was performed using molecular-based methods. Carotid intima-media thickness, flow-mediated endothelium-dependent dilatation (FMD) and endothelium-independent vasodilatation, which were used as surrogate markers of subclinical atherosclerosis, were measured in a subgroup of patients with no clinical CV disease.

RESULTS:
A lower frequency of carriers of the CCR5Delta32 allele among patients with CV events (3.4% versus 11.3%, P = 0.025, odds ratio 0.28, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.06 to 0.89) was observed. However, after adjusting for gender, age at time of RA diagnosis, and the presence of shared epitope, rheumatoid factor and classic CV risk factors in the Cox regression analysis, this reduction of CV events in CCR5Delta32 allele carriers was slightly outside the range of significance (P = 0.097; hazard ratio 0.37 (95% CI 0.12 to 1.19)). Carriers of the CCR5Delta32 deletion also showed higher FMD values than the remaining patients (CCR5/CCR5Delta32 patients: 7.03% +/- 6.61% versus CCR5/CCR5 patients: 5.51% +/- 4.66%). This difference was statistically significant when analysis of covariance was performed (P = 0.024).

CONCLUSIONS:
Our results show a potential influence of the CCR5Delta32 deletion on the risk of CV disease among patients with RA. This may be due to a protective effect of this allelic variant against the development of vascular endothelial dysfunction.
