The identification ofhost genetic factors associated with susceptibility and severity of influenzavirus infection is of paramount importance. Previous studies evaluating thepotential involvement of the CCR5Delta32 polymorphism (rs333), a 32 base pairdeletion in CC motif chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) gene, in severity and mortalityof influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infected individuals have been reported, but theirresults are quite conflicting.OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was the evaluation of the CCR5Delta32 frequency inindividuals with mild, severe and fatal influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection and itsputative association with clinical and epidemiologic data.PATIENTS/METHODS: A total of 432 individuals were included in this study andclassified according to their clinical status, into the following groups:influenza like illness (ILI) (n = 153); severe acute respiratory infection (SARI)(n = 173) and fatal (n = 106) cases. The samples were collected in the postpandemic period, from 2012 to 2018. Individuals were further stratified accordingto their clinical and epidemiological data. The CCR5Delta32 variant was genotyped byPCR amplification and a subset of samples was further submitted to Sangersequencing.RESULTS: The different clinical groups (ILI, SARI and fatal) presented similardistribution of wt/wt and wt/Delta32 genotypes and CCR5Delta32 allele frequencies.Genotype Delta32/Delta32 was not detected in our study. Additionally, no associationbetween wt/wt and wt/Delta32 genotypes and dyspnea, a clinical factor for influenzacomplications was found. Similarly, no significant differences in thedistribution of wt/wt and wt/Delta32 genotypes and CCR5Delta32 variant allele frequencieswere observed in samples from the different Brazilian geographical regions.CONCLUSIONS: The CCR5Delta32 variant does not influence the susceptibility toinfluenza A(H1N1)pdm09 severe disease or mortality in individuals from Brazil.
